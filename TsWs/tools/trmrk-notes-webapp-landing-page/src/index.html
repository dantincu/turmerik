      <p>
        A note taking app
        <span class="trmrk-warning">(in the making, so not usable yet)</span>
        that stores all user input, content & options in plain text files
        written using the minimalist and super easy to learn
        <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org">Markdown</a> syntax in order to
        be rendered as rich text documents. These text files can reside either
        on your local device ( when choosing your browser's
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">Html 5</a>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_API"
          >File System API</a

        feature )
        <span class="trmrk-warning">(currently working on it)</span> or on one
        of the supported

      <p>
        It offers the ability to organized your notes in a visual hierarchy
        similar to files & folders on any computer.
      </p>

      <h5>NOTE on Windows's max file path limit of 260 characters:</h5>
      <p>
        This limitation hinders the user's ability to nest folders with longer
        names on many levels. Examples where this is needed are many, so I'll
        just go ahead and explain how Turmerik Notes handles this limitation
        when nesting note items:
      </p>

      <p>
        For each note you create at any level in your notes's hierarchy, this
        app actually creates a pair of folders: one with the shortest possible
        name (it only consists of 3 digits that are unique for each of the
        current note's child notes) and its paired folder whose name equal the
        note you're creating, but prefixed with the same 3 digits that consist
        the name of its pair (short name) folder (so that the 2 paired folders
        will sit side by side when ordered alphabetically by any file explorer
        or cloud storage explorer apps - so you can also view and edit the notes
        you had created with this app even when you can't use this app - like
        when this app's server is down or the app needs bug fixing). And then,
        further child notes of the newly created note will reside (as folder on
        your device or cloud storage of choice) nested inside the folder with
        the short (3 digits only) name. This way, the user can nest many levels
        of notes, each note having names as long as the user wants (the length
        of the folder containing the note's name is itself trimmed if exceeding
        100 characters) without that affecting the total length of the note path
        on the file system.
      </p>

      <p>
        And the app uses this 2 folders pair strategy no matter what storage
        option the user chooses (whether it be the browser's File System API or
        a cloud storage platform). This way, whenever you want to backup & sync
        the notes you created with this app to your Windows PC, the notes will
        already be organized as files and folders exactly the way described
        above, so you'll never have to worry about any of your notes's path on
        your Windows PC's file system exceeding Windows's max file path limit of
        260 characters.
      </p>
